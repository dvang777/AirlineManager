# AirlineManager
Creating an Airline manager that allows users to look at flight info and ability to sell seats on a flight.

In this project we had to learn WPF and Data binding with our code.  From this point we had not done anything outside of console application.
So this was tough trying to create code that works and learn a new process to implement and make it fully functional.  The first 3 days I spent working on the functionality of the codes needed.
At first we set a goal that seemed achievable but was a little over our heads due to trying to bind it to UI and have it function correctly.
I felt that we could've achieved the goals we wanted through console, but this was the challenge that we had to meet.
I created tons of classes for what seemed like was necessary at the time, slowly through out the days eliminating what was either redundant or didn't belong.
Thursday and Friday was spent trying to implement code in with wpf comboboxes, list views and buttons.  That's where we had the most issues in our project.
I couldn't get the combobox to work after spending a day and a half researching and watching tutorials.  Most of our code was originally based off of user input, but we had issues implementing them into our code.
Over the weekend I rehauled our code to get it to a place where it was functioning.  A lot of our codes worked so we used them with button and text box since it was the easiest to implement.
We changed our method of originally populating passengers at around 80% of the plane capacity so that there were available seats to be bought, instead changing it to full capacity and returning sales information.
I had created a method with if statements, for loops and while loop to get user input on purchasing seats but had to be discarded due to inability to implement with UI/WPF.
If I had more time to research thuroughly I would've loved to be able to implement that to this project to make it more complete.  I did learn a lot about WPF, but there is still a ton that I haven't even touched yet.
Looking forward to learning new ways to implement new technology tools and improving the codes that we write.
